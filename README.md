# UFOs Sightings Analysis 
## Overview of Project
The main goal of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. UFO sighting data is stored as a JavaScript array and by using JavaScript as the primary coding language, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap are used to modify the aesthetics of the website that contains a table which allows to filter data based on multiple criteria. 

## Results
#### Link to UFO Sightings webpage: 
    1. We have a webpage contains an interactive table with mutiple elements for (5 elements) filters 
    by using JavaScript and HTML as you see the screenshot: Welcome to UFOs sightings to see the facts.

    2. The users can filter the data in the tabel by typing in the suggested placeholder elements such as date, city, state, country, and shape, for example, lets see how was the UFO's sightings in Florida, United States, look at the screenshot blow, there is 10 results:

## Summary
     The webpage of UFO sightings looks intutive for users and tabel is interactive with multiple filters. However there are some drawbacks of the webpage:
     1. There is no summary of data after filtered with certain criteria, such as how many raws filtered out of total rows. 
     2. Filtering placeholder does not accept uppercase but only lowercase. 
     3. It is interesting that most of the sightings spotted in the US, there is only 2 sightings in Canada. 
    Wondering why not other countries, meaning this data set is not compelete. 
    
## Recommendations:
     1. A filter on a date range might be preferable such as by typing 1/2010 should give all the sighting on January. Perhaps, the UFO Sightings occur more frequently in a specific month instead of a specific day within the month. It is recommended to add in a filter function to include a date range as the filter to aid in the investigation of UFO Sightings.
     2. It would be helpful if searches can be filtered by the duration of the UFO sighting by grouping the time entries in bins; 
     3. There should be a click button after typing the filtering criteria.
     4. Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
